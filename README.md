## Cohort 2/2024 Capstone Project: Target Market Analysis

For this capstone project, we were provided with a dataset of customer purchases, which included the amount of money spent, the number of inactive months, and other details.

## Objective
1. Design a predictive model to determine the potential customers who will purchase a product for the company to send advertisements based on available data.
2. Compare the predictive model's performance against a default option of sending the advertisement to everyone. Given;
   - Cost of sending 1 advertisement is **RM5.00**
   - Average purchase is **RM14.56**

## Findings
Our decision tree model shows **better performance** than the default option in a larger scale of customers with a marginal difference in smaller groups of customers. The model was able to achieve a recall value of **82%**.

## Algorithms
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- KNeighbors Classifier
- Logistic Regression
